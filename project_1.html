                    <p>Interview is an essential step for our group to fully understand the needs from different kinds of people.
                        In the interviews, we have interview people from different background, including countries or regions from Hong Kong,
                        Mainland China, Turkey, Brazil and Iran, and different position, like undergraduate, phd student and teacher.
                        The questions we have asked them are following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Where are you from?</li>
                        <li>During your time on campus, did you encounter any problems or challenges that you consider unfriendly?</li>
                        <li>What is your favourite animal?</li>
                        <li>Assuming the animal is a student, like the second question, what problems or challenges you think it will encounter?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The interviews allow us to analyse POV in details in later section.</p>

                    <img src="image/selling_machine.png" alt="Food selling machine">
                    <p>The food selling machine in the canteen at HKUST classifies food according to its cultural traits, which affords all students, including those from the animal kingdom, great diversity of choice. However, there is no option for users to exclude food that may be harmful due to allergies, which can be risky for some animal students.
                    </p>

                <div class="flex_content">
                    <p>Moreover, the design of the campus stair steps presents a problem for other species; smaller animals such as rabbits may find the steps too big while larger animals, like elephants, may find the steps too small. Improving these aspects would improve inclusivity and accessibility for all students on campus.

                <h3>My Role in this process</h3>
                <p>We take turns to interview different pedestrians. In this process, I have interviewed 3 people
                    and record the interview video while my groupmate is interview others for 3 times. In addition, I oftenly 
                    inspire interviewee when they did not know what to say. For instance, I give a hint to a interviewee on what trait a dog has as she doesn't know
                    what challenges will a dog encounter.
                </p>
                <p>Besides interviewing, I went to various locations to do field visit and observe the problems occuring on campus.
                    During the visit, I have tried to analyse problem by thinking from another animal's point of view, which
                    allows more ideas in Ideation Process.

            <h3>Brainstorm</h3>
            <p>We have brainstormed a few POV based on our needfinding. Here are some examples.</p>
            <div style="background:#7bf8ff">
                <h4>Rabbit</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>User: A rabbit navigating campus stairways.</li>
                    <li>Need: Steps that are appropriately sized for smaller animals, hence they are easily access and increase safety.</li>
                    <li>Insight: The oversized steps are hard for them  to use and will be dangerous.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div style="background:#1abc9c">
                <h4>Ant</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>User:  An ant trying to travel across campus.</li>
                    <li>Need: Avoidance of trampling by bigger fauna and safe pathways for movement.</li>
                    <li>Insight: There may be frequenct accidents and seomtimes lethal if large animals do not notice small animals are near them.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div style="background:#006e586e">
                <h4>Chicken</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>User: A chicken looking for food options.</li>
                    <li>Need: The ability to avoid food items that are inappropriate or highly allergic for chickens, if any.</li>
                    <li>Insight: Without a filtering option, the chicken may ingest negative food options which can result in a plethora of health issues as well as stress.
                        Also, chicken won't eat chicken !!!
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="left_border">
                <h3>Mindmap formation</h3>
                <p>The mindmap is created with 3 categories, i.e. animal characteristics, need & challenges and solutions.</p>
                <img src="image/mindmap.png" class="mindmap_imp" alt="MindMap">
                <p>In the mindmap, we proposed different solutions with different problems. For instance, 
                    for the large stair step problem,we think that stairs with different step-height should be aligned next to each other.
                    And for the small animals travel problem, we think that placing a sensor under the shoes of large animals allow instant awareness from the 
                    vibration of the sensor if small animals are near the shoes.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="left_border">
                <h3>Presentation</h3>
                <p>In our presentation, we talked about the problem regarding to the food and chicken, 
                    we recommend putting in place a system where they can directly enter their dietary preferences on the school webpage. 
                    For instance, whenever a student animal touches their student ID card on the food selling machine, the machine captures their preset preferences and omits any undesired food selections. In the case where food item filtering is done, and no suitable options are left, the user interface will give way to a view of a delivery service located off the campus. 
                    It allows the students to get fast food deliveries tailored to the individual’s requirements. This not only improves the general animal student’s dining experience, but also their health and preferences.</p>

                <h3>My Role in this process</h3>
                <p>In the brainstorm process, I was thinking about the traits of small animals and discuss the needs for them, just like the prevention
                    of trampling from big animals. Also, I was providing innovative solutions. For example, one problem we have thought is that dog cannot see the signthat is too height because 
                    of the body structure and shortness and I suggest that olfactory cues should be provided under signs since olfaction is their strength, hence they can go to different places based on different fragrant.
                    . For the solution 'dietary preference', I also suggest that delivery will be necessary if no food is available in carteen 
                    after filtering. In addition, I am responsible to write the need & challenges and solutions categories and hold the mindmap during presentation.

                <div class="two_column">
                <h3>AI Usage</h3>
                <p>We utilized AI assistance regarding the project. We requested explanations for the concepts of divergence and convergence with relation to brainstorming and, more importantly, to generate an abundance of ideas and subsequently, effectively narrow them down. 
                    In addition, we have also asked how to create a mindmap that would help track the brainstorming process, hence we could design our mindmap is a more organized and readable way. Lastly, we were curious about the vision capabilities of various animals and what kinds of signs corresponded to their differing levels of sight, so that we can keep brainstorm on different problem and their solutions by taking the inspiration into account. 
                    All in all, the communication sought to understand the project description, outline the brainstorming approach, and discuss the designs for a wide range of users.</p>

            <h1>My reflection</h1>
        </div> 
        <p class="reflection_sub_container left_border">Completing this project has broadened my understanding of how the HCI techniques of needfinding, field interviews, brainstorming, and mind mapping can be applied to solve real user problems. These methods aided us in comprehensively understanding the needs of different students, including those from different cultures and with particularistic needs. 
            I came to realize that accommodating the needs of a diverse student population is not simply important, but a prerequisite for fostering an inclusive campus environment. Blending empathy with a structured approach to resolving issues deepened my realization that addressing the needs of various users fosters innovation and improves user experience, 
            as well as makes the designs more adaptive to real-world problems.</p>
